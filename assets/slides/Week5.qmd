- Workshops: rescheduling

- Slides

- Readings

What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Next

- [Politics]{.blue} of innovation, technology, development

- Politics matters in several ways

  - At [inception]{.blue} of new prods

  - At [diffusion]{.blue} of new prods

- Today: diffusion


# Non-market competition

##

- So far: (international) politics of early innovations

- Can happen in any market, even w/ perfect competition

- Happens under other systems too!

- Next: [non-market competition]{.red}. 

  - =Competition that isn't occuring via [price]{.blue} or [quality]{.blue}

  - Diffusion stage of innovation

Why might [firms and workers]{.blue} try
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
to [slow down]{.blue} these transitions?
:::

##

- Competitive market: near [zero-sum game]{.red} for producers

- Market strategies

  - [Cut]{.red} [prices]{.blue} (maybe after invest in new tech)

  - [Differentiate]{.red} [products]{.blue}

- Not always feasible, affordable, efficient

- Esp. problem when new technologies appear

[Why]{.blue} don't firms [adapt]{.red} to
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
new technologies?
:::

## Puzzle

- Before we go into NMS: why don't firms [adapt]{.blue}?

- Firms adapt sometimes (Apple)

- Problem for firms: [disruptive]{.red} tech

- Tech can represent an [existential]{.blue} threat

  - [Sustaining]{.red} vs. [disruptive]{.red} tech

  - Hard to switch to disruptive tech: inv. in capacity, relation w/ existing customers, etc.

  - Thus NMS

## Non-market strategies

- [NMS]{.red}: firms modify [(business) environment]{.blue}, not product

- Some is "good": [corporate social responsibility]{.red}, [ESG]{.red}, ...

- But some is "bad": eliminate competition

- Bad = bad for consumers, society

  - Higher prices

  - Slower adoption of new tech

- Happens: (1) politics + (2) society + (3) within markets

## Politics (1): ideology

- [Ideology]{.red}: policy preferences of govs 

- Everyone has preferences!

- Rulers: incentives to intervene to shape world accordingly

- [Myth]{.blue} of neutral/benevolent/scientific ruler

- Problem: firms w/ risk of market failures are vulernable to change in gov preferences

- Reason: public goods often prod by gov ([political risk]{.red})

## Example

- Trump admin: opposed to climate policy

- [Clean energy]{.blue}: primary tool to cut US GHG

- US clean energy depends on [imports]{.blue}

- 2019: 30% tariff (tax) on imports of solar equipment

  - (Small) dom solar panel producers win (First Solar) 

  - Installers lose

## Politics (2): lobbying

- [Lobbying]{.red}: pressure on gov to change law

- Typically to disadvantage newcomers/advantage incumbants

  - Outlawing newcomers (Uber)

  - Barriers to entry (cost, eg via taxes, subsidies to inc)

  - Technical/health standards

- Note: often requires cooperation among firms (=public good). 

- Which industries are more likely to lobby? Remember Olson!

## Example

- FirstEnergy (Ohio): investor-owned utility that serves ~6m people ($10b+ in annual revenues)

- Problem: it relies heavily on old coal nuclear plants

- Not competitive against up-and-coming renewables

- Solution: lobby Rep majority in Ohio House to subsidize their plants (2020) (House Bill 6): $1.3b bailout

- Problem: illegal contributions (about $60m in exchange for $1.3b subsidies – NB: not bad!)

- Ongoing legal battles; Ohioans pay $130k per day...


## Within markets (1)

[Predatory pricing]{.red}

- Idea: reduce price [below]{.blue} prod cost

- Makes it impossible to newcomers to compete

- Feasible for established firms with cash

- Example: Walmart

- Hard to prove

## Within markets (2)

[Dumping]{.red}

- Same as predatory pricing, but global

- Producer in cntry A exports at low price to cntry B

- Producers in cntry B go bust

- Producer in cntry A becomes dominant

## Within markets (3)

- Monopolistic acquisitions

- Sometimes: acquisition of firms...

- Acquisition of talent ([human capital]{.red})

- Example: facebook and drop.io (Sam Lessin)

How would you push back against [lobbying]{.red} by coal companies?

::: {.r-fit-text}
Use problem-solving skills!

##

- Goal: make your firm robust to political change

- Problem: imbalance in lobbying power between you and fossil competition

- Strategies

  - Create a clean energy trade lobby

  - Encourage investments in fossil regions

  - Others?

# Conclusion

##

- Price/product competition is good...

- Disruptive tech is a threat to firms

- In response: non-market strategies

- Some are 'good'! But many are 'bad'

- Threatens development

- What about society NMS? Next topic!
