## Administration

- Office hours

- aklin@pitt.edu 

- Workshops: rescheduling

- Slides

- Readings

::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Next

- [Politics]{.blue} of innovation, technology, development

- Politics matters in several ways

  - At [inception]{.blue} of new prods

  - At [diffusion]{.blue} of new prods

- Today: diffusion


# Non-market competition

##

- So far: (international) politics of early innovations

- Can happen in any market, even w/ perfect competition

- Happens under other systems too!

- Next: [non-market competition]{.red}. 

  - =Competition that isn't occuring via [price]{.blue} or [quality]{.blue}

  - Diffusion stage of innovation

Why might [firms and workers]{.blue} try
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
to [slow down]{.blue} these transitions?
:::

##

- Competitive market: near [zero-sum game]{.red} for producers

- Market strategies

  - [Cut]{.red} [prices]{.blue} (maybe after invest in new tech)

  - [Differentiate]{.red} [products]{.blue}

- Not always feasible, affordable, efficient

- Esp. problem when new technologies appear

[Why]{.blue} don't firms [adapt]{.red} to
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
new technologies?
:::

## Puzzle

- Before we go into NMS: why don't firms [adapt]{.blue}?

- Firms adapt sometimes (Apple)

- Problem for firms: [disruptive]{.red} tech

- Tech can represent an [existential]{.blue} threat

  - [Sustaining]{.red} vs. [disruptive]{.red} tech

  - Hard to switch to disruptive tech: inv. in capacity, relation w/ existing customers, etc.

  - Thus NMS

## Non-market strategies

- [NMS]{.red}: firms modify [(business) environment]{.blue}, not product

- Some is "good": [corporate social responsibility]{.red}, [ESG]{.red}, ...

- But some is "bad": eliminate competition

- Bad = bad for consumers, society

  - Higher prices

  - Slower adoption of new tech

- Happens: (1) politics + (2) society + (3) within markets

## Politics (1): ideology

- [Ideology]{.red}: policy preferences of govs 

- Everyone has preferences!

- Rulers: incentives to intervene to shape world accordingly

- [Myth]{.blue} of neutral/benevolent/scientific ruler

- Problem: firms w/ risk of market failures are vulernable to change in gov preferences

- Reason: public goods often prod by gov ([political risk]{.red})

## Example

- Trump admin: opposed to climate policy

- [Clean energy]{.blue}: primary tool to cut US GHG

- US clean energy depends on [imports]{.blue}

- 2019: 30% tariff (tax) on imports of solar equipment

  - (Small) dom solar panel producers win (First Solar) 

  - Installers lose

## Politics (2): lobbying

- [Lobbying]{.red}: pressure on gov to change law

- Typically to disadvantage newcomers/advantage incumbants

  - Outlawing newcomers (Uber)

  - Barriers to entry (cost, eg via taxes, subsidies to inc)

  - Technical/health standards

- Note: often requires cooperation among firms (=public good). 

- Which industries are more likely to lobby? Remember Olson!

## Example

- FirstEnergy (Ohio): investor-owned utility that serves ~6m people ($10b+ in annual revenues)

- Problem: it relies heavily on old coal nuclear plants

- Not competitive against up-and-coming renewables

- Solution: lobby Rep majority in Ohio House to subsidize their plants (2020) (House Bill 6): $1.3b bailout

- Problem: illegal contributions (about $60m in exchange for $1.3b subsidies – NB: not bad!)

- Ongoing legal battles; Ohioans pay $130k per day...


##

::: {.r-fit-text}
Is lobbying always a bad thing?
:::

##

- So far: lobbying=slow down transition=bad

- But: good reasons for gov intervention exist!

- First: help innovation (already discussed)

- Second: address inequality between 'good' and 'bad' tech

## Bad tech lock-in

- Perfect market: superior tech replace inferior tech

- Market failures: problem of externalities

  - 'Good' tech produces [positive externalities]{.red}

  - 'Bad' tech produces [negative externalities]{.red}

- 'Good' tech cannot win alone **even** when it's socially desirable

- Example: [carbon lock-in]{.red}

## Within markets 

- Next: within-markets

- Note: not _exactly_ an NMS...

- But still about changing business environment


##  

- [Predatory pricing]{.red} and [dumping]{.red}

  - Idea: reduce price [below]{.blue} prod cost

  - Dumping: same but export

  - Makes it impossible to newcomers to compete

  - Example: Walmart. But: hard to prove

- Monopolistic acquisition(s): acquire firm/talent ([human capital]{.red})

  - Example: facebook and drop.io (Sam Lessin) 


# Conclusion

##

- Price/product competition is good...

- Disruptive tech is a threat to firms

- Response is often: non-market strategies

- Some are 'good'! But many are 'bad'

- Threatens development

- What about _society_ NMS? Next topic!
