What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Today

- [Politics]{.blue} of innovation, technology, development

- Politics matters in several ways

  - At [inception]{.blue} of new prods

  - At [diffusion]{.blue} of new prods

- Today: finish inception, start diffusion

##

- What's the problem with R&D? Can't the market solve that?

- Fundamental problem: [collective action failures]{.red}

  - = indivs behave in a way that's not optimal for society

  - Note: optimal$\neq$rational. Optimal=normative

  - Politics = study of CA problems

- Main types of CA probs: [public goods]{.red}, [coordination failures]{.red}, [commitment problems]{.red}

- Today: public goods

##

| | **Excludable**      | **Non excludable** |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Rival** | Private      | Open-access       |
| **Non-rival** | Club   | Public        |

- Definitions

  - [Excludable]{.red}: users can be excluded from accessing good

  - [Rival]{.red}: stock of good decreases with consumption

##

- [Private goods]{.red}: your pen

- [Open access good]{.red}: public parc

- [Club good]{.red}: Netflix

- [Public goods]{.red}: ideas!

- [Market failure]{.red}:

  - Situations where markets don't work optimally

  - Common outside of private goods

## 

- Problem: public goods are generally [under-produced]{.blue}

- Why? [Free-riding]{.red}

- Often captured by the [prisoner's dilemma]{.red}

- Example: you are asked to contribute to a group project

- PD is useful, but doesn't capture uncertainty of result

## {.smaller}

- N: people who would benefit from project

- n: people who contribute (aside from you)

- B: your benefit if project succeeds; everybody gets it (public good)

- $\frac{n}{N}$: probability of success of project

- c: your cost of participating

- Cost-benefit:

  - If you don't participate: $B\cdot\frac{n}{N}$

  - If you participate: $B\cdot\frac{(n+1)}{N}-c$

  - Participation is worth it if $\frac{B}{N}>c$

## 

- R&D is a [public good]{.red}!

- Thus: here, research is done if $\frac{B}{N}>c$ (if model is true!)

- Suppose $N$ is the US (300m), $B=\mbox{\$}1m$

- You won't contribute if costs > 0.3 cents!

- R&D will be underprovided...

- General insight by @olson65: with public goods...

  - Large N: bad

  - [Diffuse interests]{.red}: bad

##

- Problem: you don't capture benefits from your investments

- [Ideas]{.blue} are [domestic+global public goods]{.red}!

- Need solution to free-riding

- How can we solve this problem?

## Side note: problem-solving

- Many models (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control)

- First: define the [problem]{.blue}

  - What _should_ the goal be? Ethics!

- Second: establish [mechanisms]{.red} leading to prob

  - What is the [cause]{.blue} of prob? Theory and evidence

- Third: design+test [interventions]{.blue} (policies)

  - What is the [solution]{.blue}? Experiment

Problem: research is a [global]{.blue} [public good]{.red}!
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
How do you solve it?
:::

- Define goals

- Mechanisms of prob

- Solutions to (root of) prob

## Goals and mechanisms

- **Goal(s)**

  - Possibly: _High levels of R&D_, _$700b/year_, _$500b in clean energy, $200 in electric cars_, _1000 startups by 2050_, etc.

  - Consequentialism ethical view

- **Mechanisms**

  - Free-riding: investors don't get rewarded

  - Domestic + international

## Solutions

- Need to solve [domestic]{.blue} free-riding: 

  - [Incentivize]{.blue} private sector: patents, prizes, subsidies

  - [Socialize]{.blue} research: public unis, research centers

- Need to solve [global]{.blue} free-riding: 

  - World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

  - International treaties (Patent Cooperation Treaty, 1970)

  - Punishment?

# Conclusion

##

- We (often) want new goods/services

- Innovations are generally needed to obtain them

- Innovation is often [under-produced]{.red} ([public good]{.red} and [free-riding]{.red})

- Solutions: domestic+international rules to solve free-riding


# Non-market competition

##

- So far: (international) politics of early innovations

- Can happen in any market, even w/ perfect competition

- Happens under other systems too!

- Next: [non-market competition]{.red}. 

  - =Competition that isn't occuring via [price]{.blue} or [quality]{.blue}

  - Diffusion stage of innovation



## Context

##

![Source: Future Business Tech](./materials/futurebusinesstech.png)
 


##

- Competitive market: near [zero-sum game]{.red} for producers

- Market strategies

  - Cut [prices]{.blue} (possibly after adopting similar tech)

  - Increase [product differentiation]{.red}

- Not always feasible, affordable, efficient

- Problem when new technologies appear

## Puzzle

- Before we go into NMS: why don't firms [adapt]{.blue}?

- Firms adapt all the time

  - Apple: computer to phone to iphone, etc.

- Problem for firms: [disruptive]{.red} tech

- Tech can represent an [existential]{.blue} threat

  - [Sustaining]{.red} vs. [disruptive]{.red} tech

  - Hard to switch to disruptive tech, thus NMS

## Non-market strategies

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB


A[Politics] <--> B(Firm 1) & C(Firm 2) <--> D(Society)

    subgraph Market
    B <--> C
    end
```

## Non-market strategies

- Idea: firms modify [(business) environment]{.blue}, not product

- Some is "good": [corporate social responsibility]{.red}, ESG, ...

- But some is "bad": eliminate competition

- Bad = bad for consumers, society

  - Higher prices

  - Slower adoption of new tech

- Happens w/ politics + w/ society + within markets

## Politics (1)

- [Ideology]{.red}: policy preferences of govs 

- Everyone has preferences!

- Rulers: incentives to intervene to shape world accordingly

- [Myth]{.blue} of neutral/benevolent/scientific ruler

- Problem: markets w/ market failures are exposed to change in gov preferences

## Example

- Trump admin: opposed to climate policy

- [Clean energy]{.blue}: primary tool to cut US GHG

- US clean energy depends on [imports]{.blue}

- 2019: 30% tariff (tax) on imports of solar equipment

  - Domestic solar panel producers win (First Solar) (small share)

  - Installer lose

## Politics (2)

- [Lobbying]{.red} 

- Modification of the law to disadvantage newcomers

  - Outlawing newcomers (Uber)

  - Barriers to entry (cost, eg via taxes)

  - Standards

- Note: often requires cooperation among firms (=public good)

- Feasible for firms that can cooperate 

## Example

- FirstEnergy (Ohio): investor-owned utility that serves ~6m people ($10b+ in annual revenues)

- Problem: it relies heavily on old coal nuclear plants

- Not competitive against up-and-coming renewables

- Solution: lobby Republican majority in Ohio House to subsidize their plants (2020) (House Bill 6)

- Problem: illegal contributions (about $6m in exchange for $1.3b subsidies – NB: not bad!)

- Ongoing legal battles


## Within markets (1)

[Predatory pricing]{.red}

- Idea: reduce price below prod cost in foreign markets

- Makes it impossible to newcomers to compete

- Feasible for established firms with cash

- Example: Walmart

## Within markets (2)

[Dumping]{.red}

- Same as predatory pricing, but global

- Producer in cntry A exports at low price to cntry B

- Producers in cntry B go bust

- Producer in cntry A becomes dominant

## Within markets (3)

- Monopolistic acquisitions

- Acquisition of firms...

- Acquisition of talent ([human capital]{.red})

- Example: facebook

# Conclusion

##

- Price/product competition is good...

- But often doesn't happen

- Disruptive tech is a threat to firms

- In response: non-market strategies

- Some are 'good'! But many are 'bad'

- Threatens development
