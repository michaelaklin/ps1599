# Policy report

## Aim of assignment

- Take your research report and show that you can think about its implications + solve problem(s)

- Research report: _who is/isn't interested in and supportive of renewable energy technology_

- Now: think about policy solutions to increase support among those who aren't interested/supportive

- Audience: President Biden or Governor Shapiro (PA)

## Illustration

> My research report shows that people with _low levels of education_ are _less_ supportive of _renewable energy_. Possibly, this is because they are unaware of the benefits of renewable energy. Thus, I recomment (a) an information campaign targeted toward adults, (b) an education campaign in high schools.

## Requirement

- Short paper (3-5 pages)

- Worth 30% 

- Due on 4/21

- Template + instructions on the website

## Content

- Executive summary (0.5-1 page): overview of the paper

- Literature review + your finding(s) (research report) (~1p)

  - Adapt your literature review from research report

  - Add your own findings at the end

- Policy options (1-2p)

  - Provide 3 policy ideas

  - Explain which one should be prioritized

- Next steps (0.5p)

  - How will you favorite policy be implemented?

## Grading

- Effective policies (do they address the problem?)
