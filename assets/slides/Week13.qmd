##

- Problem-solving addresses...

  - [Natural]{.blue} problems
  - [Individual]{.blue} problems
  - [Social]{.red} problems

- Social problems have many causes

  - So far: public goods/externalities

  - Next: [coordination]{.red} and [commitment]{.red} problems

  - Matters for policy

# Coordination problems

## Definition

- People benefit if they [coordinate]{.red} their behavior

  - I don't care strongly what we do as long as we adapt to each other

  - Canonical example: driving side

- When actors fail: coordination failure

- Differs from public goods

  - [no]{.blue} incentive to free-ride
  
  - problem is to select an equilibrium

## Coordination problems in markets

- (a) [Format wars]{.red}: sectors often create industry-wide [formats]{.blue}

  - Consumers don't care which format (smaller=better)

  - Important for firm planning

  - Eg: blu-ray vs HD DVD, QWERTY

- (b) [Network effects]{.red}

  - = value to consumers goes up w/ more consumers

  - Eg: phones, vaccines, Playstation, Minidiscs

- Both relevant for sustainable technology

## Case 1: network effects

- Consider electric vehicles (EV) and ignore externalities

- Still a challenge to switch from gas to EV

- Reason: both EV and gas require [infrastructures]{.red}

  - Infra is only provided if enough customers exist

  - If not: useless car

How would you ensure [a transition to EV]{.blue}?

## Policies

- Classic (same solutions as for [public goods]{.red})

  - Pigouvian tax on cars

  - Subsidies for EV

- Coordination-specific solutions

  - Subsidy for infrastructure (charging stations)

  - R&D on flexible charging stations 

  - Regulations on new apartment buildings

##

1. Law. Rule out one some options. Eg EU and gasoline cars

2. Services. Build charging stations. 

3. Money. Subsidize EV

4. Taxes. Tax gasoline cars

5. Moral. ?

## Case 2: format wars

- Electric vehicles must be charged

- Currently: <300 miles

- Problem: brands have competing charging standards

- Equivalent: having different plugs based on your electric supplier

| **Tesla supercharger**      | 2, 1     | 0, 0 |
| **CCS**   | 0, 0  | 1, 2 |

- Two equilibria

- But [distributional]{.red} impact 

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
Assume you're working for the White House. 
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you select an EV standard?
:::


##

- Difficult choice: can the White House predict the future?

- One possibility: let the market decide (like blu-ray vs HD DVD)

- Problem: slows down the transition to EV

- Can use technical criteria. But same problem: no idea which format is superior in the long term

- Maybe best (?): force industry to pick

##

1. Law. Impose to all a standard that you think is superior

2. Services. Build charging stations.

3. Money. Compensate the loser

4. Taxes. Compensate the loser (lower taxes)

5. Moral. ?

<!-- By doing so, actors can unleash benefits (or avoid costs) that they might suffer if they don’t 
Difference with public goods:
Public goods: our incentives push us to a bad equilibrium 
With coordination problems: no incentive to free-ride; the problem is to select an equilibrium
Many examples: driving side, investments, technological standards, selecting a technology (electric cars) w/ network effects, etc. -->

## Conclusion

- Public goods are not the only social problems

- Coordination failures are also important

- Relevant for sustainable technology

  - Network effects
  
  - Format coordination

- Policies are different from those for public goods

- Implication for your projects

# Commitment problems

## Definition

- Actors sometimes make promise about the future

- These promises might not be [credible]{.red}

- Eg: teenage wanting to go out tonight and clean room tomorrow

- Problem: knowing this, actors will make worse decisions today

- Eg: peace treaty

## 

![](./materials/commitment_aklin.png)

##

- Despite peace being superior, actors with foresight will not go for it

- Problem: risk of being vulnerable later if you agree to disarm now

- Thus: need to find a way to generate a [credible commitment]{.red}

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you overcome this
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
[commitment problem]{.red}? 
:::

##

- Law. Joint control of gov/legislature? Legal institutions? UN Blue Helmets?

- Services. Shift control of military?

- Money. Provide separatist resources to re-buy weapons if needed?

- Taxes?

- Moral: publicly tie your hands.

## Risk and sustainable industries

- Commitment problems are common in new industries

  - Need gov support to grow

  - But govs come and go

- Creates [political risks]{.red}

- Issue: who will invest in clean tech if govs might pull the plug later?

## Case: off-grid renewable energy

- About 700m w/o electricity

- Could be powered w/ coal...

- Better solution: off-grid tech

- Electricity is generated locally 



##

- In practice: off-grid mostly provided by private firms

  - Material (turbines, solar panels, etc.)

  - Sales (connection of households, firms)

- Requires public support 

- Two problems

  - Governments change. Democracy!

  - Customers: unwillingness to pay bills

- In India: both problems very relevant

How can you overcome this commitment problem? 
:::


::: {.r-fit-text}
From the side of (a) the [gov]{.blue} and (b) the [firm]{.blue}...
:::

## Government strategies

- Law: legal rules (eg SupC vs gov), law enforcement (customers)

- Services: ?

- Money: fund gov projects upfront 

- Taxes?

- Morality: public commitments/[audience costs]{.red}

## Firm strategies

- Law: n/a (reserved to governments)

- Services: smart metering

- Money: upfront payment, pay-as-you-go

- Taxes: n/a (reserved to governments)

- Morality?

<!-- - Note: prob is gov itself!

- Smart metering

- Robust contract enforcement

- Internationalization of firms -->

## Conclusion

- Credible commitments are very important

- Yet different from coordination/public goods

- Dynamic problem

- Requires to find [credible commitments]{.red}


# Industrial policy and climate change

##

- Three problems: public goods, coordination, commitment

- Can be addressed individually

- But that's sometimes insufficient

- Solution (?): [industrial policy]{.red}

## History

- 19th century: conservation

- Up to 1960s: other priorities (WWI, Great Depression, WWII, Cold War)

- Since 1960s: growth of environmental movement

- Since 1980s: concern about climate change and ozone layer

- To keep warming limited: need to reach net-zero by 2050

- [Wicked problem]{.red}: dom/global public goods, coordination, commitments

## Climate policy

- Clinton: [international]{.blue} climate treaty (Kyoto Protocol)

  - Treaty to deal w/ global negative externalities
  - Tech transfer to deal w/ domestic social problems 

- Congress: [domestic]{.blue} carbon pricing

  - Failures in 2003, 2005, 2008

  - Waxman–Markey: carbon trading scheme (2009)


##

- Problem: all these efforts failed

- Domestic: no carbon pricing

- International: very soft global rules

- [Political]{.blue} problem: hard to mobilize voters

  - Taxes create [distributional]{.red} effects

  - Hard for green voters to vote for others ([credibility]{.red})

@Skocpol2013
:::

## Solution

- Potential solution: [industrial policy]{.red}

- Idea: vast set of policies to jumpstart an industry

- Deals with all 3 problems:

  - Public goods: public resources

  - Coordination: creates entire markets

  - Commitment: creates pro-policy constituencies

## Biden

- Three packages passed 2021-2022 ([law]{.red})

  - Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)
  - CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS) 
  - Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 

- Total: over $500b public investments ([service]{.red}), research ([service]{.red}), and tax credits ([money/tax]{.red}) for clean energy

## Economic effects

- Makes clean energy cheaper via [subsidies]{.blue}

- Makes clean energy cheaper via [tech innovation]{.blue}

- [Incentivizes]{.blue} private sector

- Addresses [public good]{.red} and [commitment]{.red} problems

- What about [commitment]{.red} problem (by government)?

##

- **Not** just about economics

- Politics: create strong pro-climate policy constituencies

- Important: could overcome commitment problem depending on next elections

- But could [backfire]{.blue}: picking winners, inefficiencies, consumer costs

## Conclusion

- Major social problems: public goods, coordination, commitment

- Policies can address each

- But when all happen together: [wicked problem]{.red}

- One solution: [industrial policy]{.red}

- Pessimism: rarely works as intended: larger the policy, the higher the odds that something goes wrong...
