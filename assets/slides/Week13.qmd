## Administration

- Office hours, aklin@pitt.edu 

- Exam

- Shorter class today

##

Brief reminder

- Research paper: who is supportive/unsupportive of clean energy (age, education, gender, etc.)

- Policy paper: suggest policies to deal with the problems identified in _Research Paper_

- Chuang's office hours: Fr 12-2:30pm

- Next two Mondays: drop-in session for your final projects

- Lots of material on course website!

##

- Problem-solving addresses...

  - [Natural]{.blue} problems
  - [Individual]{.blue} problems
  - [Social]{.red} problems

- Social problems have many causes

  - So far: public goods/externalities

  - Next: [coordination]{.red} and [commitment]{.red} problems

  - Matters for policy

# Coordination problems

## Definition

- People benefit if they [coordinate]{.red} their behavior

  - I don't care strongly what we do as long as we adapt to each other

  - Canonical example: driving side

- When actors fail: coordination failure

- Differs from public goods

  - [no]{.blue} incentive to free-ride
  
  - problem is to select an equilibrium

## Coordination problems in markets

- (a) [Format wars]{.red}: sectors often create industry-wide [formats]{.blue}

  - Consumers don't care which format (smaller=better)

  - Important for firm planning

  - Eg: blu-ray vs HD DVD, QWERTY

- (b) [Network effects]{.red}

  - = value to consumers goes up w/ more consumers

  - Eg: phones, vaccines, Playstation, Minidiscs

- Both relevant for sustainable technology

## Case 1: network effects

- Consider electric vehicles (EV) and ignore externalities

- Still a challenge to switch from gas to EV

- Reason: both EV and gas require [infrastructures]{.red}

  - Infra is only provided if enough customers exist

  - If not: useless car

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Gasoline car**      | 1, 1     | 0, 0 |
| **Electric**   | 0, 0  | 1, 1 |

- Equilibria?

| **Gasoline car**      | 1, 1     | 0, 0 |
| **Electric**   | 0, 0  | 2, 2 |

- Equilibria?

How would you ensure [a transition to EV]{.blue}?
:::

## Policies

- Classic (same solutions as for [public goods]{.red})

  - Pigouvian tax on cars

  - Subsidies for EV

- Coordination-specific solutions

  - Subsidy for infrastructure (charging stations)

  - R&D on flexible charging stations 

  - Regulations on new apartment buildings

##

1. Law. Rule out one some options. Eg EU and gasoline cars

2. Services. Build charging stations. 

3. Money. Subsidize EV

4. Taxes. Tax gasoline cars

5. Moral. ?

## Case 2: format wars

- Electric vehicles must be charged

- Currently: <300 miles

- Problem: brands have competing charging standards

- Equivalent: having different plugs based on your electric supplier

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Tesla supercharger**      | 2, 1     | 0, 0 |
| **CCS**   | 0, 0  | 1, 2 |

- Two equilibria

- But [distributional]{.red} impact 

##

Assume you're working for the White House.

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you pick a standard?
:::


##

- Difficult choice: can the White House predict the future?

- One possibility: let the market decide (like blu-ray vs HD DVD)

- Problem: slows down the transition to EV

- Can use technical criteria. But same problem: no idea which format is superior in the long term

- Maybe best (?): force industry to pick

##

1. Law. Impose to all a standard that you think is superior

2. Services. Build charging stations.

3. Money. Compensate the loser

4. Taxes. Compensate the loser (lower taxes)

5. Moral. ?

<!-- By doing so, actors can unleash benefits (or avoid costs) that they might suffer if they don’t 
Difference with public goods:
Public goods: our incentives push us to a bad equilibrium 
With coordination problems: no incentive to free-ride; the problem is to select an equilibrium
Many examples: driving side, investments, technological standards, selecting a technology (electric cars) w/ network effects, etc. -->

## Conclusion

- Public goods are not the only social problems

- Coordination failures are also important

- Relevant for sustainable technology

  - Network effects
  
  - Format coordination

- Policies are different from those for public goods

- Implication for your projects

# Commitment problems

## Definition

- Actors sometimes make promise about the future

- These promises might not be [credible]{.red}

- Eg: teenage wanting to go out tonight and clean room tomorrow

- Problem: knowing this, actors will make worse decisions today

- Eg: peace treaty, long-term subsidies

## 

![](./materials/commitment_aklin.png)

## Example: political risk

- Commitment problems are common in new industries

  - Need gov support to grow

  - But govs come and go

- Creates [political risks]{.red}

- Issue: who will invest in clean tech if govs might pull the plug later?

# Industrial Policy: The IRA

##

- Three problems: public goods, coordination, commitment

- Can be addressed individually

- But that's sometimes insufficient

- Solution (?): [industrial policy]{.red}

## History

## Content

## Solutions

- Public goods: public resources

- Coordination: creates entire markets

- Commitment: tries to create constituencies who will fight for it even if Republicans win
