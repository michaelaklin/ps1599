## Today

- Last time: 
  - Welfare can be a legitimate goal for humankind
- Today (and next week): 
  - Definition of welfare (+measurement)
  - History global/European development 
  - Connection to technology

# Welfare: definition and measurement

##

- Welfare = good

- True for both [utilitarianism]{.red} and [egalitarianism]{.red}

- Okay, but _what_ is welfare?

- In practice: vastly diverging views. 

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you [define]{.blue}
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
(and [measure]{.blue}) [welfare]{.red}?
:::

##

- Not an academic question

- Two approaches to define welfare

- 1st: [subjective]{.blue}. Let people say what makes them "well"

- [Pros]{.blue}: flexible, respectful of personal views

- [Cons]{.blue}: 

  - Are all personal views legitimate in society?
  - Hard to measure

##

- 2nd approach: [objective]{.blue}. Decide for all of us what is 'legitimate' welfare.

- Potential candidates: physical wellbeing, happiness, equality of opportunity, access to resources, etc
  
- [Pros]{.blue}: avoids 'bad' preferences; can be measured

- [Cons]{.blue}: defines welfare in a narrow way (spiritual? etc.)

## Two things to note...

- 1. These obj measures can be equated to ["development"]{.red}

- [Narrow]{.red} version: how modern an economy is

- [Amartya Sen]{.red}'s version: economic opportunities + political freedom + protection from extreme poverty

- [Broad]{.red} version: adds social stuff (gender rights, etc.)

- Often [criticized]{.blue}: western-centric, materialistic

- Often [measured]{.blue} by the [Human Development Index]{.blue}: schooling + GNI (similar to GDP) + life expectancy

##

- 2. Most of these measures can be proxied by [economic growth]{.red}

- Often measured by GDP: 

  - Value of goods+services produced in a jurisdiction during a certain time

  - Eg GDP of Pennsylvania for 2022 is $722b

- Note:

  - Not the same as household income/wage, but close

  - Doesn't tell us about [distribution]{.red} of income

  - Economic growth $\neq$ development


##  Physical well-being

## Happiness

- Happiness: end goal?

  - Locke: yes! Bentham: yes!

  - US declaration of indepence: yes!

  - But remember: could be happy for bad reasons

- Does happiness increase with economic development? 

  - Yes [within and across countries]{.blue}

  - Not [over time]{.blue}

  - = Paradox of happiness [(Easterlin 1974)]{.gray}

  - One explanation: hedonic treadmill

## Summary so far

- a. What we want: improve people's [welfare]{.red}

  - Reason: welfare is plausibly a **just** goal!

- b. What determines welfare? [Economic growth/development]{.red}

  - Welfare could be equated to well-being

  - Development correlates highly with well-being

  - Thus: development is probably good!

- c. How do we get development? [Technological innovations]{.red}




# History of development

## Development vs growth

- [Growth]{.blue}: increase in prod and diversity of goods and services

- [Development]{.blue}: deep econ transformation (+pol & social)

  - Example: shift from manufacturing to services

- Note:

  - Growth w/o development is possible

  - Development w/o growth is possible

  - But the two are generally connected

##

- Development is continuous, but two critical junctures

1. Neolithic period ("Stone Age") (~12,000 BCE)

2. Industrial revolution (~1760-1890s)

# 1. Neolithic revolution

## Pre-neolithic period

- Early homo sapiens: nomadic hunter-gatherers

- Strong limits on population growth

  - Europe: 1 person needed ~4 sq miles

  - Tropical regions: 1 person needed 0.4 sq m

- [Implications?]{.red}

- Small tribes, no surplus, few activities outside of food, no trade, no innovation

## Neolithic period

![Source: @matranga2022.](materials/Matranga2022.png)

New [technology]{.red}: agriculture [(@Bairoch1997)]{.gray}



##

- [Causes]{.blue}: climatic change 

  - End of [Last Glacial Period]{.blue} (~12,000 BCE)

  - Higher temperatures = harder to hunt

  - Longer dry season: need food that can be stored

- Additional causes: social development, property rights (animals, storage, gardens)

## Consequences of Neolithic revolution

- Short term: few benefits (smaller, more joint health issues)

- Long term: radical transformation...

- [Population]{.blue}: agri surplus $\rightarrow$ larger pop

- [Labor]{.blue}: non-farming jobs (crafts, trade)

- [Social]{.blue}: development of [cities]{.blue}: Middle East: ~3500 BCE, Harrapa (Punjab, India): ~2000 BCE, China: ~1400 BCE

- [Laws]{.blue} and [institutions]{.blue}: Hammurabi code (1750 BCE), common defense, taxes, etc.

- Civilizations Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome

# 2. Industrial revolution

## 

- Period of profound [economic]{.blue}, [social]{.blue}, [political]{.blue} transformations (1760-1890)

- Shift from agriculture to industry

  - 1st Industrial rev: ~1760-1800

  - 2nd Industrial rev: 1860-1890

  - Since then: 3rd and 4th IR

- Enabled by new energy tech & services: steam, coal, oil, electricity

## England

|                  | 1500 | 1700 | 1900 | 1950 |
|---------        |------|------|------|------|
| Calories        |       1.8k | 2.2k | 3k  | 3.1k |

| Location        |  Rural |  Rural  | Rural | Urban |
| Literacy rate   | 5-15% | ~50% | 90%+ | 95%+ |

## Context

- Neolithic to 1600s: no big trend in living standards for median

- Does _not_ mean stability (Black Death:~-50%, Thirty Years War: 4-8m deaths; climate shocks)

- Does _not_ mean [stagnation]{.blue}. Many innovations!

- Medieval Europe:

  - Trade: global trade network (Asia, Americas)

  - Capitalism: banking, accounting, money

  - Technology: agri, paper, medical science, universities

##

- Change centered around western Europe starting in 1600s ("[Age of Reason]{.red}")

  - Science: physics, statistics, philosophy (Hume, Descartes)

  - Modern state (property rights+law, "proto-democracy")

  - Markets

## 1st Industrial revolution

- Starts in UK, 1760s

- Driven by new [innovations]{.red} in [energy]{.red}

## Some consequences

- [Labor market]{.blue}. Eg:

  - UK w/ train station $\rightarrow$ pop growth + shift male workers away from agriculture

  - Germany: train tracks $\rightarrow$ pop growth for bigger parishes 

- Erasure of local [culture]{.blue}. Eg France: 50% of pop doesn't speak French in 1789

- [Urbanization]{.blue}: working class, marxism, demand for social protection, education

## 3rd Industrial revolution

## What's next?

## GDP/capita since 1950

pwt100 = read_dta("./materials/pwt100.dta")

# Remove small states with lots of variation in denominator
pwt100 %>% data.frame() %>%

# Conclusion

- [Development]{.blue} $\neq$ economic growth and $\neq$ [linear]{.blue}

- Two key moments: ~12,000 BCE and 1760-1890

  - Neolithic revolution
  - Industrial revolution

- Both: dramatic changes for humanity caused by [technology]{.red}

  - Agriculture (Neolithic)
  - Energy (Industrial revolution)

- Next: the [side effects]{.blue} of the Industrial revolution

Consequences of transportation technology revolution

- [Job market]{.blue}. Eg:

  - UK: towns that received a train station $\rightarrow$ population growth + shift male workers away from agriculture ([Bogart et al 2022]{.gray})

  - Germany: train tracks $\rightarrow$ population growth, but only for parishes that were already bigger and more advanced ([Braun and Franke 2022]{.gray})

- Erasure of local [culture]{.blue}. Eg France: 50% of pop doesn't speak French in 1789 [(Hobsbawm 1990)]{.gray}


## Critical moment 4


# Development and technology




# Conclusion

##

- If you care about [consequences]{.red} (consequentialism)...

- If the consequences you care is [welfare]{.red} (welfarism)

- If you define welfare in terms of (economic) [development]{.red} (material or not)...

- Then you will need [technological innovations]{.red}
