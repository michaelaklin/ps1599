## Plan for today

- Last time: 
  - Good reasons to care about development
  - Development can be (imperfectly) proxied with economic and social measures
- Today: 
  - History global development 
  - Connection to technology

<!-- Theme: 

-->

# History of development

## Pre-modern era

## Critical moment 1: mid-1600s

Global trade

Development of science: experimental science, theoretical science (probability theory)

## Critical moment 2: late 1700s

Political revolution (US, France)

1st Industrial Revolution

Energy revolution

## GDP take-off

## GDP/capita since 1950

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "GDP per capita. Figure: Aklin. Data source: Penn World Tables."

library(haven)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
pwt100 = read_dta("./materials/pwt100.dta")

# Remove small states with lots of variation in denominator
pwt100 %>% data.frame() %>%
dplyr::filter(country != "Brunei Darussalam" & country != "China, Macao SAR" &  country != "Luxembourg" & country != "Qatar" & country != "United Arab Emirates") %>%
ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rgdpe/pop, color=country)) +
geom_line() +
xlab("Year") +
ylab("GDP per capita") +
theme_bw() +
theme(legend.position="none") 
```


## Deep social changes

Urbanization


## Critical moment 3: mid/late-1800s

- 2nd Industrial Revolution

- New boundaries thanks to new technologies


- Transportation
  - Railroads
  - Steamboats
- Other infrastructures
  - Electricity
- Electricity (lighting, factories)

## World is becoming small

Consequences of transportation technology revolution

- [Job market]{.blue}. Eg:

  - UK: towns that received a train station $\rightarrow$ population growth + shift male workers away from agriculture ([Bogart et al 2022]{.gray})

  - Germany: train tracks $\rightarrow$ population growth, but only for parishes that were already bigger and more advanced ([Braun and Franke 2022]{.gray})

- Erasure of local [culture]{.blue}. Eg France: 50% of pop doesn't speak French in 1789 [(Hobsbawm 1990)]{.gray}


## Critical moment 4


# Development and technology




# Conclusion

##

- If you care about [consequences]{.red} (consequentialism)...

- If the consequences you care is [welfare]{.red} (welfarism)

- If you define welfare in terms of (economic) [development]{.red} (material or not)...

- Then you will need [technological innovations]{.red}
