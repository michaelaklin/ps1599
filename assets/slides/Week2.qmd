## Today

- Last time: 
  - Welfare can be a legitimate goal for humankind
- Today (and next week): 
  - Definition of welfare (+measurement)
  - History global/European development 
  - Connection to technology

# Welfare: definition and measurement

##

- Welfare = good

- True for both [utilitarianism]{.red} and [egalitarianism]{.red}

- Okay, but _what_ is welfare?

- In practice: vastly diverging views. 

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you [define]{.blue}
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
(and [measure]{.blue}) [welfare]{.red}?
:::

##

- Not an academic question

- Two approaches to define welfare

- 1st: [subjective]{.blue}. Let people say what makes them "well"

- [Pros]{.blue}: flexible, respectful of personal views

- [Cons]{.blue}: 

  - Are all personal views legitimate in society?
  - Hard to measure

##

- 2nd approach: [objective]{.blue}. Decide for all of us what is 'legitimate' welfare.

- Potential candidates: physical well-being, happiness, equality of opportunity, access to resources, etc
  
- [Pros]{.blue}: avoids 'bad' preferences; can be measured

- [Cons]{.blue}: defines welfare in a narrow way (spiritual? etc.)

## Two things to note...

- 1. These obj measures can be equated to ["development"]{.red}

- [Narrow]{.red} version: how "modern" an economy is

- [Amartya Sen]{.red}'s version: economic opportunities + political freedom + protection from extreme poverty

- [Broad]{.red} version: adds social stuff (gender rights, etc.)

- Often [criticized]{.blue}: western-centric, materialistic

- Often [measured]{.blue} by the [Human Development Index]{.blue}: schooling + GNI (similar to GDP) + life expectancy

##

- 2. Most measures can be proxied by [economic growth]{.red}

- Often measured by GDP: 

  - Value of goods+services produced in a region over time

  - Eg GDP of Pennsylvania for 2022 is $722b

- Note:

  - Not the same as household income/wage, but close

  - Doesn't tell us about [distribution]{.red} of income

  - Economic growth $\neq$ development


##  Physical well-being

## Happiness

- Happiness: end goal?

  - Locke: yes! Bentham: yes!

  - US declaration of indepence: yes!

  - But remember: could be happy for bad reasons

- Does happiness increase with economic development? 

  - Yes [within and across countries]{.blue}

  - Not [over time]{.blue}

  - = Paradox of happiness [(Easterlin 1974)]{.gray}

  - One explanation: hedonic treadmill

## Summary so far

- a. What we want: improve people's [welfare]{.red}

  - Reason: welfare is plausibly a **just** goal!

- b. What determines welfare? [Economic growth/development]{.red}

  - Welfare could be equated to well-being

  - Development correlates highly with well-being

  - Thus: development is probably good!

- Next Q: how do we get development? 




# History of development

## Development vs growth

- [Growth]{.blue}: increase in prod and diversity of goods and services

- [Development]{.blue}: deep econ transformation (+pol & social)

  - Example: shift from manufacturing to services

- Note:

  - Growth w/o development is possible

  - Development w/o growth is possible

  - But the two are generally connected

##

- Development is continuous, but two critical junctures

1. Neolithic period ("Stone Age") (~12,000 BCE)

2. Industrial revolution(s) (~1760-1890s)

# 1. Neolithic revolution

## Pre-neolithic period

- Early homo sapiens: nomadic hunter-gatherers

- Strong limits on population growth

  - Europe: 1 person needed ~4 sq miles

  - Tropical regions: 1 person needed 0.4 sq m

- [Implications?]{.red}

- Small tribes, no surplus, few activities outside of food, no trade, no innovation

## Neolithic period

![Source: @matranga2022.](materials/Matranga2022.png)

$\rightarrow$ New [technology]{.red}: agriculture [[@Bairoch1997]]{.gray}



##

- [Causes]{.blue}: climatic change 

  - End of [Last Glacial Period]{.blue} (~12,000 BCE)

  - Higher temperatures = harder to hunt

  - Longer dry season: need food that can be stored

- Additional causes: social development, property rights (animals, storage, gardens)

## Consequences of Neolithic revolution

- Short term: few benefits (smaller, more joint health issues)

- Long term: radical transformation...

- [Population]{.blue}: agri surplus $\rightarrow$ larger pop

- [Labor]{.blue}: non-farming jobs (crafts, trade)

- [Social]{.blue}: development of [cities]{.blue}: Middle East: ~3500 BCE, Harrapa (Punjab, India): ~2000 BCE, China: ~1400 BCE

- [Laws]{.blue} and [institutions]{.blue}: Hammurabi code (1750 BCE), common defense, taxes, etc.

- Civilizations Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome

# 2. Industrial revolution

## 

- Misnomer... 

- Period of [economic]{.blue}, [social]{.blue}, [political]{.blue} transformations

- Shift from agriculture to industry

  - 1st Industrial rev: ~1760-1830 (UK)

  - 2nd Industrial rev: ~1870-1914

  - Since then: 3rd and 4th IR

- Enabled by new energy tech: steam, spinning jenny, etc

::: {.r-fit-text}
What makes countries/regions
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
[grow]{.red} (economically)?
:::

## Types of growth

Growth (and development) can happen in four ways

1. _Smith-ian_ growth: [market]{.red} expansion

2. _Solow-ian_ growth: [capital]{.red} accumulation (machines, etc.)

3. Scale growth: more people, [division of labor]{.red}

4. _Schumpetarian_ growth: [technological]{.red} disruptions

- #1 and #2 limited potential (cannot 'rediscover' China...)

- #3 helps but is slow

- #4 is key

## Context: Medieval times and Renaissance

- Until 1600s: no clear trend in (median) living standards

- Does _not_ mean [stability]{.blue} (eg Black Death:~-50%)

- Does _not_ mean [stagnation]{.blue}

  - Trade (Smith-ian): global trade networks

  - Capitalism (Solow-ian): banking, accounting, money

  - Technology: agri, paper, medical science, universities

- But few [permanent]{.blue} changes

::: footer
@le1992medieval, @Greif1993, @cesana2017origin
:::

## 1600s

- Change in W Europe starting around 1600s ([Enlightenment]{.red})

- Expansion of regional+global markets (goods, finance)

- Growth of science: physics, statistics, philosophy

- Development of modern state (property rights+law)

- But still little change in welfare


:::footer
@Bairoch1997, @mokyr2018british, @North1991
:::


## 1st Industrial revolution

- Schumpetarian process

- Starts in UK, 1760s-1830s (spreads later)

- Rapid [productivity growth]{.red} (output per worker/year) 

  - More goods and products available

  - Declining prices of such goods

  - Shift from agriculture to manufactuing ([industrialization]{.red})

  - Eventually: large increase in GDP and welfare

## How?

![Source: @goldsmith2014long.](./materials/Goldsmith2014.png)


## How?

Three steps

- [Tech]{.red} change in small sectors ([mechanization]{.red}): 

  - Textiles. Cotton and "spinning Jenny"

  - Minnig. Coal, steam engine, deep mining.

  - Metalurgy. Coal, blast furnace.

- These sectors become more important overall

  - Size of the economy

  - Urban workers

- Later: technological [spillovers]{.red} (learning)

:::footer
@mokyr2018british
:::

## Broader impact
<!-- view{.smaller} -->

- Not just about goods. Austen to Dickens...

- Local to impersonal markets ("[social change]{.red}" school; Polanyi)

- Local to national economies ("[macroeconomic]{.red}" school; Kuznets)

- Household prod to firms ("[industrial organization]{.red}" school; Marx)

- Technology for labor and capital ("[technology]{.red}" school; Landes)



:::footer
@mokyr2018british, @allen2009british
:::


## Deep causes

<!-- - Hard to ascertain -->
- Tech was key...

- But what triggered its development?

- Why UK 1760s? Mystery! Hypotheses: 

  - Colonies? Small and poor...

  - Political institutions? But Netherlands...

  - Energy? Netherlands vs. Belgium...

  - "Culture" (Max Weber, etc.)? But Belgium...

<!-- - Critical role played by changes in 

  - Agriculture: weaker demand for workers

  - Industry: stronger demand for consumer goods

  - Technology -->

## Major consequences

- [Short term]{.blue}

  - Period of low growth (!)

  - Low wages (!) and urban poor ("proletariat")

- [Long term]{.blue}

  - Improvements in life quality

  - Rise in living standards, esp among poor
  
  - Decline of rural world

  - Expansion of public services (schools, public health)

# 2nd Industrial revolution

##

- Pause of innovation after 1820s

- Around 1870s until WWI ([recombinant growth]{.red})

- 2nd generation of innovations

  1. Transportation infrastructures (trains, steam boat)

  2. Energy infrastructures (eg grid) for [mass production]{.red}

## Some consequences

- [Labor market]{.blue}. Eg:

  - UK w/ train station $\rightarrow$ pop growth + shift male workers away from agriculture

  - Germany: train tracks $\rightarrow$ pop growth for bigger parishes 

- Erasure of local [culture]{.blue}. Eg France: 50% of pop doesn't speak French in 1789

- [Urbanization]{.blue}: working class, marxism, social democracy demand for social protection, education

<!-- # 3rd and 4th Industrial revolutions

## 

- New phases of transformation of societies 

- 3rd IR: "digital" revolution (~1960s onward)

- 4th IR: "cyber" revolution: AI, Internet of Things, etc. 

- Technology is key

  - Energy services

  - Computers

## GDP/capita since 1950

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "GDP per capita. Figure: Aklin. Data source: Penn World Tables."

library(haven)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
pwt100 = read_dta("./materials/pwt100.dta")

# Remove small states with lots of variation in denominator
pwt100 %>% data.frame() %>%
dplyr::filter(country != "Brunei Darussalam" & country != "China, Macao SAR" &  country != "Luxembourg" & country != "Qatar" & country != "United Arab Emirates") %>%

xlab("Year") +
ylab("GDP per capita") +
theme_bw() +
theme(legend.position="none") 
``` 
-->

## Challenges

- Currently: 3rd and 4th IR

- Are technological innovations slowing down?

  - Worry about [stagnation]{.red}

  - But maybe just hard to measure?

- Are technologies hurting us?

  - Worry about [sustainability]{.red}

  - Unprecedented risks of disaster

# Conclusion

##

- IR = unprecedented levels of welfare

- Diff with past: few cases of backsliding

- Doesn't mean everything is great...

  - Inequality across/within ctries

  - Hedonic treadmill

- Yet: would you trade your seat with anyone in the past?

- Bigger problems: what's next?

  - Negative side effects of tech

  - Will growth stop?

Consequences of transportation technology revolution

- [Job market]{.blue}. Eg:

  - UK: towns that received a train station $\rightarrow$ population growth + shift male workers away from agriculture ([Bogart et al 2022]{.gray})

  - Germany: train tracks $\rightarrow$ population growth, but only for parishes that were already bigger and more advanced ([Braun and Franke 2022]{.gray})

# Conclusion

##

- If you care about [consequences]{.red} (consequentialism)...

- If the consequences you care is [welfare]{.red} (welfarism)

- If you define welfare in terms of (economic) [development]{.red} (material or not)...

- Then you will need [technological innovations]{.red}
