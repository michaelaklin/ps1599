Administration

- Office hours + meetings

- Emails

- Website

- Question?

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Plan for today

- In theory:

  - Welfare $\leftarrow$ Development

  - Development $\leftarrow$ Technology

  - Thus: technology $\checkmark$

- Evidence #1: Neolithic revolution

- Today: evidence #2, Industrial revolution(s)

- Today/next time: when technology goes too far


# 2. Industrial revolution

## 

- Misnomer... 

- Period of [economic]{.blue}, [social]{.blue}, [political]{.blue} transformations

- Shift from agriculture to industry

  - 1st Industrial rev: ~1760-1830 (UK)

  - 2nd Industrial rev: ~1870-1914

  - Since then: 3rd and 4th IR

- Enabled by new energy tech: steam, spinning jenny, etc

## England

What makes countries/regions
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
[grow]{.red} (economically)?
:::

## Types of growth

Growth (and development) can happen in four ways

1. _Smith-ian_ growth: [market]{.red} expansion

2. _Solow-ian_ growth: [capital]{.red} accumulation (machines, etc.)

3. Scale growth: more people, [division of labor]{.red}

4. _Schumpetarian_ growth: [technological]{.red} disruptions

- #1 and #2 limited potential (cannot 'rediscover' China...)

- #3 helps but is slow

- #4 is key

## Context: Medieval times and Renaissance

- Until 1600s: no clear trend in (median) living standards

- Does _not_ mean [stability]{.blue} (eg Black Death:~-50%)

- Does _not_ mean [stagnation]{.blue}

  - Trade (Smith-ian): global trade networks

  - Capitalism (Solow-ian): banking, accounting, money

  - Technology: agri, paper, medical science, universities

- But few [permanent]{.blue} changes

## 1600s

- Change in W Europe starting around 1600s ([Enlightenment]{.red})

- Expansion of regional+global markets (goods, finance)

- Growth of science: physics, statistics, philosophy

- Development of modern state (property rights+law)

- But still little change in welfare

## 1st Industrial revolution

- Schumpetarian process

- Starts in UK, 1760s-1830s (spreads later)

- Rapid [productivity growth]{.red} (output per worker/year) 

- Three steps

  1. [Tech]{.red} change in small sectors ([industrialization]{.red} via [mechanization]{.red}): cotton, iron, etc.

  2. These sectors become more important overall

  3. After decades: technology spills over to other sectors

## Broader view
<!-- view{.smaller} -->

- Not just about goods. Transformation...

- Local to impersonal markets ("[social change]{.red}" school; Polanyi)

- Local to national economies ("[macroeconomic]{.red}" school; Kuznets)

- Household prod to firms ("[industrial organization]{.red}" school; Marx)

- Technology for labor and capital ("[technology]{.red}" school; Landes)

- From Austen to Dickens...

## Deep causes

<!-- - Hard to ascertain -->

- Why UK 1760s? Mystery! Hypotheses: 

  - "Culture" (Max Weber, etc.)? But Belgium...

  - Colonies? Small and poor...

  - Political institutions? But Netherlands...

  - Energy? Netherlands vs. Belgium...

- Critical role played by changes in 

  - Agriculture: weaker demand for workers

  - Industry: stronger demand for consumer goods

  - Technology

## Major consequences

- Short term

  - Period of low growth (!)

  - Low wages (!) and urban poor ("proletariat")

- Long term

  - Improvements in life quality

  - Rise in living standards, esp among poor
  
  - Decline of rural world

  - Expansion of public services (schools, public health)


# 2nd Industrial revolution

- Pause of innovation after 1820s

- Around 1870s until WWI: 

- 2nd generation of innovations

  1. Transportation infrastructures (trains)

  2. Energy infrastructures (eg grid) for [mass production]{.red}

## World is becoming small

![Isochrome map of US. Source: Atlas of the historical geography of the United States](materials/Atlas_hist_geo_us.png)

##

![Isochrome map of France](materials/distance_map_france_extract.png)

## Some consequences

- [Labor market]{.blue}. Eg:

  - UK w/ train station $\rightarrow$ pop growth + shift male workers away from agriculture

  - Germany: train tracks $\rightarrow$ pop growth for bigger parishes 

- Erasure of local [culture]{.blue}. Eg France: 50% of pop doesn't speak French in 1789

- [Urbanization]{.blue}: working class, marxism, demand for social protection, education

# 3rd and 4th Industrial revolutions

## 

- New phases of transformation of societies 

- 3rd IR: "digital" revolution (~1960s onward)

- 4th IR: "cyber" revolution: AI, Internet of Things, etc. 

- Technology is key

  - Energy services

  - Computers

## GDP/capita since 1950

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "GDP per capita. Figure: Aklin. Data source: Penn World Tables."

library(haven)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
pwt100 = read_dta("./materials/pwt100.dta")

# Remove small states with lots of variation in denominator
pwt100 %>% data.frame() %>%
dplyr::filter(country != "Brunei Darussalam" & country != "China, Macao SAR" &  country != "Luxembourg" & country != "Qatar" & country != "United Arab Emirates") %>%
ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rgdpe/pop, color=country)) +
geom_line() +
xlab("Year") +
ylab("GDP per capita") +
theme_bw() +
theme(legend.position="none") 
```

## Challenges

1. Are technological innovations slowing down?

  - Worry about [stagnation]{.red}

  - Challenge measuring growth; GDP is not adequate

2. Are technologies hurting us?

  - Worry about [sustainability]{.red}

  - Unprecedented risks of disaster

# Conclusion

##

- IR = unprecedented levels of welfare

- Diff with past: few cases of backsliding

- Doesn't mean everything is great...

  - Inequality across/within ctries

  - Hedonic treadmill

- Yet: would you trade your seat with anyone in the past?

- Bigger problems: what's next?

  - Negative side effects of tech

  - Will growth stop?
