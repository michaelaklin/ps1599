## Administration

- Office hours, emails...

- COVID policy

- Readings on website

- Midterm

##

- Allowed 1 regular-sized sheet of paper, both sides

- Duration: class time (arrive on time!)

- Mix of short answers + multiple choice + longer answers (maybe)

- Readings, course content are all included

# Technology and Sustainability

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Plan for today

- Finish sustainability

- Economics and politics of innovations

<!-- Theme: 
Goals of society: deontology vs consequentialism
Two forms of consequentialism
Conclusion: we often want to generate the best consequences
What consequences? Happiness (=utility)!
But: doesn't work that great. Nepal. Trump paradox.
Instead: human development.
But: complicated.
Instead: GDP!
Thus: centrality of development for our societies.
-->


## Problem...

- Modern economies rely on fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil)

- When burned: generate greenhouse gas emissions

- Increase warming effect + destabilize climate

- Environmental consequences: temperature, droughts, etc.

- Social consequences: food shocks and conflicts

How would you define sustainability?

## New problems

- 19th century: conservation movement (Sierra Club 1892: Muir, Pinchot)

- First half of 20th c: other priorities (WWI, WWII, Cold War)

- 1960s: 

  - Concerns about air, water pollution (_Silent Spring_)

  - Concern about over-population [@Ehrlich1971]

- 1970s/80s: concerns about ozone layer

- About the same time: concern about climate change

## New politics

- Domestic: emergence of... 

  - green [lobbies]{.red} (EDF 1967)
  
  - green [parties]{.red} (Germany, ...)

- International: 

  - International env treaties (Montreal Protocol, 1987)

  - Enc activism: _Our Common Future_ (Brundtland Report, 1987)

## Sustainability

What defines [**sustainable** development]{.red}?

- Approach 1: "ecological" approach

- Bruntland report, _Population Bomb_, _Limits to Growth_

. . . 

> "every generation should leave water, air and soil resources as pure and unpolluted as when it came on earth... each generation should leave undiminished all the species of animals it found existing on earth"

. . .

- Policy implication: hard curb on consumption

- [Thoughts?]{.red}

## 

- Impossible to implement + probably undesirable

- Approach 2: "economist's" approach

- Solow, EDF, etc.

- From a _sustainability_ perspective: you don't owe future gen specific resources...

- you owe them the [services]{.blue} that they provide

- Eg: we don't owe "ipad kids" oil, we owe them the ability to travel from A to B at reasonable speed


##

::: {.r-fit-text}
How convincing is [Solow's]{.red} definition?
:::

## Conclusion

- Technology has generally been a +

  - (at least for material comfort)

- Technology has always been [disruptive]{.red} for society...

- ... but current changes in tech are different:

  - [simultaneous]{.blue} crises ("polycrisis")

  - [scale]{.blue} of crises: global

##

Puzzle for this class:

::: {.r-fit-text}
How can we ensure [broad]{.blue} sustainability?
:::

# Conclusion to Part I

- Familiar with ethics: welfare, consequentialism, utilitarianism, etc.

- Familiar with the relations between tech, growth, development, welfare

- **If** you care about welfare, and if you define welfare as dev, then tech innovation is **ethically** just

- But: not all tech is desirable! Negative side effects

- Next questions: where does innovation come from? How to stimulate good/discourage bad tech?

# Supply-side failures I

## Basics

- We are interested in [output]{.red}

- Output is generated by [factors of production]{.red}

  - Labor, capital, land

- ... and [inputs]{.red}

  - raw materials, energy, ...

- Output = inputs transformed by factors of prod

- Technology = how "well" FoP transform inputs


## Definitions

- [Technology]{.red}: "manner of accomplishing a task" (Webster)

- [Invention]{.red}: a new idea or new process

- [Innovation]{.red}: "_market_ introduction of a technical or organisational novelty" [@Schumpeter1934b] (emph added)

- Note: 

  - invention+innovation=change

  - invention=individual, innovation+tech=social
