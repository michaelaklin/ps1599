What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Starting point

- We now know what we [aim for]{.blue}: [economic development]{.red}

- We know why we want it: [material welfare]{.red}

- It also [often]{.blue} reduces inequality (across+within ctries)

- Development comes from ([tech]{.red}) [innovations]{.red}

- But need to address tech's [negative externalities]{.red}

- Big question: how?


# Supply-side failures I: Innovations


## Basic model

- We are interested in economic [output]{.red} (aka GDP)

- Output is generated by [factors of production]{.red}...

  - [Labor]{.blue}, [capital]{.blue}, [land]{.blue}

- ... and [inputs]{.red}

  - raw materials, energy, ...

##

![](./materials/pathdiagram.png)

- Output = inputs transformed by factors of prod

- Technology = how "well" FoP transform inputs

##

- Core question: where do new goods/services come from?

- Need to think about markets and dev of new products

- Typical lifespan of a new product

  - Stage 1: early development

  - Stage 2: diffusion
  
  - Stage 3: maturity

- Two parallel S-curves

## Supply-side

##

- We will talk about [demand]{.red} side problems later

- For now: [supply]{.red} side. Two key moments:

  - At "birth": problem of generating new ideas ([innovation]{.red}) 

  - At "puberty": prob of diffusing products ([non-market competition]{.red})

- So: [where]{.blue} does innovation come from?


## Definitions

- [Technology]{.red}: "manner of accomplishing a task" (Webster)

- [Invention]{.red}: a new idea or new process

- [Innovation]{.red}: "_market_ introduction of a technical or organisational novelty" [@Schumpeter1934b] (emph added)

- Note: 

  - tech=level vs. invention+innovation=change

  - invention=individual vs. innovation+tech=social

##

- Typically: innovation is the result of [research & development]{.red}

- First issue: design a [cost-effective]{.blue} product ([supply]{.red}) 

- R&D: invention $\rightarrow$ innovation

  - Identify demand to solve a problem (surveys, etc)

  - Identify a solution (invention)

  - Deploy a solution in the market (innovation)

- R&D can be public, private (ATT, Google), in-between (Pitt, RAND)

- 2019: US ($658n, 27%), China ($526b, 22%)

## Case study: renewable energy

- 1970s: oil shocks + env concerns

  - $\rightarrow$ demand for innovation in energy

- Problem: no alternative to oil+coal

- Solutions: new energy technologies!

  - [France]{.blue}: investments in nuclear

  - [US, DE, DK]{.blue}: investments in renewable energy

##

- What's the problem with R&D? Can't the market solve that?

- Fundamental problem: [collective action failures]{.red}

  - = indivs behave in a way that's not optimal for society

  - Note: optimal$\neq$rational. Optimal=normative

  - Politics = study of CA problems

- Main types of CA probs: [public goods]{.red}, [coordination failures]{.red}, [commitment problems]{.red}

- Today: public goods

##

| | **Excludable**      | **Non excludable** |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Rival** | Private      | Open-access       |
| **Non-rival** | Club   | Public        |

- Definitions

  - [Excludable]{.red}: users can be excluded from accessing good

  - [Rival]{.red}: stock of good decreases with consumption

##

- [Private goods]{.red}: your pen

- [Open access good]{.red}: public parc

- [Club good]{.red}: Netflix

- [Public goods]{.red}: ideas!

- [Market failure]{.red}:

  - Situations where markets don't work optimally

  - Common outside of private goods

## 

- Problem: public goods are generally [under-produced]{.blue}

- Why? [Free-riding]{.red}

- Often captured by the [prisoner's dilemma]{.red}

- Example: you are asked to contribute to a group project

- PD is useful, but doesn't capture uncertainty of result

## {.smaller}

- N: people who would benefit from project

- n: people who contribute (aside from you)

- B: your benefit if project succeeds; everybody gets it (public good)

- $\frac{n}{N}$: probability of success of project

- c: your cost of participating

- Cost-benefit:

  - If you don't participate: $B\cdot\frac{n}{N}$

  - If you participate: $B\cdot\frac{(n+1)}{N}-c$

  - Participation is worth it if $\frac{B}{N}>c$

## 

- R&D is a [public good]{.red}!

- Thus: here, research is done if $\frac{B}{N}>c$ (if model is true!)

- Suppose $N$ is the US (300m), $B=\mbox{\$}1m$

- You won't contribute if costs > 0.3 cents!

- R&D will be underprovided...

- General insight by @olson65: with public goods...

  - Large N: bad

  - [Diffuse interests]{.red}: bad

##

- Problem: you don't capture benefits from your investments

- [Ideas]{.blue} are [domestic+global public goods]{.red}!

- Need solution to free-riding

- How can we solve this problem?

## Side note: problem-solving

- Many models (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control)

- First: define the [problem]{.blue}

  - What _should_ the goal be? Ethics!

- Second: establish [mechanisms]{.red} leading to prob

  - What is the [cause]{.blue} of prob? Theory and evidence

- Third: design+test [interventions]{.blue} (policies)

  - What is the [solution]{.blue}? Experiment

::: {.r-fit-text}
Problem: research is a [global]{.blue} [public good]{.red}!
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
How do you solve it?
:::

- Define goals

- Mechanisms of prob

- Solutions to (root of) prob

## Goals and mechanisms

- **Goal(s)**

  - Possibly: _High levels of R&D_, _$700b/year_, _$500b in clean energy, $200 in electric cars_, _1000 startups by 2050_, etc.

  - Consequentialism ethical view

- **Mechanisms**

  - Free-riding: investors don't get rewarded

  - Domestic + international

## Solutions

- Need to solve [domestic]{.blue} free-riding: 

  - [Incentivize]{.blue} private sector: patents, prizes, subsidies

  - [Socialize]{.blue} research: public unis, research centers

- Need to solve [global]{.blue} free-riding: 

  - World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

  - International treaties (Patent Cooperation Treaty, 1970)

  - Punishment?

# Conclusion

##

- We (often) want new goods/services

- Innovations are generally needed to obtain them

- Innovation is often [under-produced]{.red} ([public good]{.red} and [free-riding]{.red})

- Solutions: domestic+international rules to solve free-riding
