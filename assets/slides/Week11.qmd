## Administration

- Office hours

- aklin@pitt.edu 

- Schedule: to be updated

# Policy as problem-solving

## Why problem-solving?

Jobs vary on two dimensions

- [Cognitive]{.red} vs [manual]{.red}: workers provide thoughts or manual labor

- [Routine]{.red} vs [non-routine]{.red}: tasks are being repeated or not

- Most jobs have a mix of all four 

  - Eg doctor does admin, helps physically move patients, thinks about diagnosis

- Prospects for routine jobs/tasks are not great...

##

- Future labor market...

  - topic of this class

  - train you to overcome it!

- Assignments:

  - Data analysis

  - Solving problems

# Policy report

## Aim of assignment

- Take your research report and show that you can think about its implications + solve problem(s)

- Research report: _who is/isn't interested in and supportive of renewable energy technology_

- Now: think about policy solutions to increase support among those who aren't interested/supportive

- Audience: President Biden or Governor Shapiro (PA)

## Illustration

> My research report shows that people with _low levels of education_ are _less_ supportive of _renewable energy_. Possibly, this is because they are unaware of the benefits of renewable energy. Thus, I recomment (a) an information campaign targeted toward adults, (b) an education campaign in high schools.

## Requirement

- Short paper (3-5 pages)

- Worth 30% 

- Due on 4/21

- Template + instructions on the website

## Content

- Executive summary (0.5-1 page): overview of the paper

- Literature review + your finding(s) (research report) (~1p)

  - Adapt your literature review from research report

  - Add your own findings at the end

- Policy options (1-2p)

  - Provide 3 policy ideas

  - Explain which one should be prioritized

- Next steps (0.5p)

  - How will you favorite policy be implemented?

## Grading

- Effective policies (do they address the problem?)

- Balance creativity/realism (are the policies realistic and do they overcome typical bottlenecks?)

- Clarity of paper (direct, jargon-free language)

# Policymaking and problem-solving

## Principles of policymaking

![](./materials/publicpolicy.png)

## 1st step: aim/goal

- Identify a goal

- Politics/society: what do you want the world to be like (ethics)

- Business: market shares, profits, etc.

- Others: achievements (sports), personal goals, etc.

- In general: helps to draw a measurable target

  - "Reduce poverty by 10%" vs "Making people happy"

## 2nd step: diagnostics

- Explain why the problem is happening

- Different types of problems

- 1. [Individual problems]{.blue}. Eg smoking.

- 2. [Social problems]{.blue}. Eg prisoner's dilemma.

- 3. ["Natural" problems]{.blue}. Eg natural disasters, sickness.

- Often: problems are a combo of these!


## 3rd step: solutions

- Look for solutions (policymaking!)

- Type of solutions depends on type of problems

- Need to solve the fundamental cause(s) of the problem

- Eg for climate change:

  - CC is caused by evil oil companies

  - CC is caused because negative externalities aren't 'internalized'

## Public policy

[Tools]{.blue} used by [public authorities]{.blue} to [modify]{.blue} our environment to (presumably) [solve]{.blue} individual/social/natural problems

- Often: solve [social]{.blue} problems. Eg

  - R&D as public good

  - Carbon emissions as negative externalities

  - Electric infrastructure as a coordination problem

- Sometimes [individual]{.blue} problems

  - Knowledge/awareness

  - Individual commitment problem (addiction)

##

- The set of tools you have depends on your [position]{.blue}

- [Inside]{.blue} the state: mayor, governor, bureaucrat, etc.

- [Outside]{.blue} the state: firms, nonprofits, etc. (lobbying)

- Variation in resources + legal rights

## Domestic policy tools

1. [Law]{.red}. Eg no smoking zones. 

2. [Services]{.red}. Eg public schools, law enforcement, etc.

3. [Money]{.red}. Eg subsidies for low-income households.

4. [Taxes]{.red}. Eg Pigouvian taxes

5. [Morality]{.red}. Eg calls for masking.

::: {.r-fit-text}
Often, we have several tools for a problem.
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
How should we [select]{.blue} policies?
:::

## Criteria

- [Efficiency]{.blue}: does policy A achieve a goal at lowest cost?

- [Equity]{.blue}: is the outcome fair to stakeholders?

- [Due process]{.blue}: is the policy legal and moral?

- [Effectiveness]{.blue}: can it realistically be adopted?

- Also:

  - Does the policy have side effects?

  - Could the policy be misused?



## Example: climate change

1. Law: emission standards for cars

2. Services: subsidized public transports

3. Money: subsidies for renewable energy companies, industrial policy (eg IRA)

4. Taxes: carbon tax

5. Morality: 'evil' oil companies

- [Which one should be picked?]{.red}

## 

- Economists: like carbon taxes (efficient)

- Economists: dislike industrial policy and subsidies (bureaucratis picking winners)

- Politics: like industrial policy and subsidies (buys off supporters) 

- Politics: dislike carbon taxes (vote loser)

- Nonprofits: complicated goals

## International policy tools

- Policy tools so far work for domestic sovereign

- But: no global government to deal with global problems

##

::: {.r-fit-text}

:::

to deal with [global]{.blue} issues?
:::

##

1. Law: international treaties, international organizations

2. Services: defense umbrella

3. Money: foreign aid

4. Taxes: tariffs on imported goods

5. Morality: soft power, military coercion (?)

## Your turn

Objective: reduce car pollution in Pittsburgh

1. Design goals

2. Identify fundamental causes

3. List solutions
