# We covered quite a bit of ground...

# <!--fit--> What is the goal of humankind?

## What should our society aim for?

## What would an ideal world look like? 

## What should the state do to reach these goals?

## 0. Autarchism

<!-- First answer: nothing! -->

* These questions do not make sense

* Liberal-libertarianism (Locke, Jefferson)

* Anarcho-libertarianism (Emerson, Rand)

<!-- Modern version of Kant: donation
Q: what was Kant fighting against? -->

## 1. Deontology

* (a) (Many) religious views
* (b) Rational views
  * Kant: you don't control result of actions
  * Can't be blamed for **outcomes**
  * Can only be responsible for **actions**

## 2. Consequentialism

* What matters is the **consequence** of a behavior and not the behavior itself
* Utilitarianism
  * Right consequence: max total welfare
  * Bentham, Mills, etc.
* Egalitarianism
  * Rawls, Dvorkin, etc.

## Why does this matter?

* We are facing an era of **polycrises**
* Yet this doesn't tell us **what** to do
* What kind of **standard** do you want to set for yourself? For your community? Government?
* Not just a theoretical question...

---

## My biggest failure...

* Hired in 2008 as an analyst for a consultant
* Project: help the European Union design an _early warning system_
* Could we find a way to use satellite data to predict wars?
* Sounds good, right?
* <span style="color:red;">What was the EU's true motive?</span>

---

* Primary motivation was to reduce immigration...
* I powered ahead anyway...
* Logic: push/pull factors that drive migration
* If we could reduce push factors $\rightarrow$ less migration
* Key: ability to predict conflicts and intervene _prior_ to move
* My job: statistical analysis of change in land-use

---

* (Decided soon after to go to graduate school)
* Yet point remains: essential to understand...
  * How to identify goals
  * (Ideally goals that are _just_, but not always)
  * How to model/understand bottlenecks
  * Come up with rigorous solutions

---

To summarize...
* In this course, we had three aims:
  * How to define problems
  * How to understand their causes
  * How to address them
* We covered tons of ground to do so...

* I look forward to seeing how you put this together in your report
* (Due on Friday, midnight, on Canvas)
* Beyond this: I hope this was a course that was _different_ and that helped you develop a _different_ set of skills
* (Make sure to share your feedback in OMETs)
