# Demand-side failures

##

- Puzzle: why doesn't [new+better]{.blue} tech replace [old+bad]{.blue} tech?

- So far: supply-side explanations

  - Innovation failures

  - Diffusion failures

- Hidden assumption: people want new+better tech

- Is this true? [Demand-side]{.red} failures

## 

<!-- 
1. Preferences
2. 
3. Coordination problems -->

- [Demand-side]{.red} prob: issues with demand for 'good' tech

- Happens at three (four) levels:

  - Individual, household, social/community, (firms)

- The [calculus of demand]{.blue}

  - Benefits

  - Costs

  - Misc.

## Benefits

- Two types of goods/services:

  - Consumption goods

  - Investment goods

  - Some goods are both (eg internet)

- Key Q: what is the [utility]{.red} of acquiring a given tech?

  - At indiv level: benefits are about [taste]{.red}, [cultural pref]{.red}

  - At social level: B conditioned by [collective action issues]{.red}

## Problem

- Perfect market: supply responds to demand for new tech

- But we are interested in cases w/ [market failures]{.red}

- Prob for goods w/ [positive externalities]{.red} (not captured)

- [Private]{.red} benefits < [social]{.red} benefits

- Example: should I use an electric car or gasoline car?

- Right now: electric car ~$10k more than gasoline



## Costs

- Need to include the cons side

- Natural starting point: pecunary cost

- Other costs (symbolic, etc)

- Problem: [negative externalities]{.red} are not included!

- Thus: good tech might be overpriced and bad tech underpriced

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you solve the pricing problem
::: 

::: {.r-fit-text}
of 'good' tech being [overpriced]{.red}...
::: 

::: {.r-fit-text}
and 'bad' tech being [underpriced]{.red}?
::: 

##

- Increase [private cost]{.red} of negative externalities
  
  - [Pigouvian]{.red} taxes

  - Trading systems. Eg EU ETS

  - Symbolic cost (eg fur)

- Increase [private benefit]{.red} of positive externalities

  - [Subsidies]{.red}. Eg tax credits

  - Symbolic gains (eg make green cool)

- [Which ones are politically more likely to work?]{.red}

## Misc

- Decision are never just a matter of money

  - Signaling, branding, etc

- Tech-specific issue: new products are unknown

  - [Unawareness]{.red}

  - [Uncertainty]{.red} regarding quality

- Example: solar technology in India

## Household dynamics

- So far: discussion focused on [individuals]{.blue}

- But what about [households]{.blue}?

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
Can you think of reasons why moving from
::: 

::: {.r-fit-text}
[individuals]{.blue} to [households]{.blue}  
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
could change the [decision calculus]{.blue}?
:::

##

- Individuals: cost-benefit

- Decision-maker is not an individual '[rational]{.red}' actor

- Instead: [intra-household bargaining]{.blue}+[externalities]{.red}

- Includes biases derived from econ and cultural factors

  - Who earns the money?

  - Who makes decisions about what?

  - Whose views carry more weight?

## Example: benefits of electricity access

- Context: India, >1b inhabitants, GDP/cap $2k

- But until ~2010: 700m w/o electricity

- Successful electrification programs (RGGVY, Saubhagya)

- Questions: who [benefits]{.blue} from electrification?

- Study conducted in rural northern India

- Ownership and use of appliances

##

- Electrification is great!

- But uneven benefits...

- Technology is not neutral: interacts with local politics, culture, economics

- Here: gendered dimension of technology

## Example (2): clean cook stoves

- Modern economies: use non-solid fuel (elec, gas)

- Poorer economies (~2.4b): solid fuel (wood, kerosene, charcoal, dung)

- Impact: indoor air pollution. [Who will be affected?]{.red}

- WHO: 3.2m deaths per year (2020); 237k children under 5

- Pulmonary diseases, lung cancer, breathing issues

## Example (continued)

- [Solution]{.blue}: clean (or at least improved) cookstoves

- [Diagnostic]{.blue}: problem of cost (externalities) for HH and for countries

- [Solution]{.blue}: global funding effect led by Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (2010, Clinton)

- [Goal]{.blue}: replace solid-fuel cookstoves w/ clean ones (~100m units)

- In practice: distribution of 28m, seldom used

## Example (continued)

- Many problems...

- [Benefits]{.blue}: air pollution is not seen as a threat: awareness + intra-hh bargaining

- [Costs]{.blue}: good clean stoves are expensive

- Study by @Alemetal2023: 

  - Experiment on clean cookstoves in Ethiopia, 2013

  - Randomize offer to buy to spouse, men, women

  - Evaluate willingnes to pay and usage

::: {.r-fit-text}
Based on what you now know...
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
How would you [improve sales+use]{.blue} of clean cookstoves?
:::

##

- **Goal**: replace trad cookstoves with improved/clean ones in rural areas

- **Problem**: current tech isn't designed

- Adapt goods/services to meet cultural preferences

  - Not just about engineering!

- Women sale's representative

  - Example from India

- Subsidies specific for cookstoves (can't be captured by husband)

  - Not something economists would recommend!

- Others?

# Conclusion

##

- 'Good' tech is often disadvantaged

- Problem of positive/negative [externalities]{.red}

- Good tech must be affordable!

- But not just about money: beliefs about problems, cultural values, etc. 

- Importance of social component in tech adoption
