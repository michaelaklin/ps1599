##

::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

##

- In 'regular' times: mostly competition via prices and quality

- In times of disruptive tech: non-market strategies

- Two so far: lobbying and electing friendly pols

- Today:

  - Finish NMS

  - Start demand side issues


## Within markets (1)

[Predatory pricing]{.red}

- Idea: reduce price [below]{.blue} prod cost

- Makes it impossible to newcomers to compete

- Feasible for established firms with cash

- Example: Walmart

- Hard to prove

## Within markets (2)

[Dumping]{.red}

- Same as predatory pricing, but global

- Producer in cntry A exports at low price to cntry B

- Producers in cntry B go bust

- Producer in cntry A becomes dominant

## Within markets (3)

- Monopolistic acquisitions

- Sometimes: acquisition of firms...

- Acquisition of talent ([human capital]{.red})

- Example: facebook and drop.io (Sam Lessin)

How would you push back against [lobbying]{.red} by coal companies?

::: {.r-fit-text}
Use problem-solving skills!
:::

##

- Goal: make your firm robust to political change

- Problem: imbalance in lobbying power between you and fossil competition

- Strategies

  - Create a clean energy trade lobby

  - Encourage investments in fossil regions

  - Others?





# Conclusion

##

- Price/product competition is good...

- Disruptive tech is a threat to firms

- In response: non-market strategies

- Some are 'good'! But many are 'bad'

- Threatens development

- What about society NMS? Next topic!


# Demand-side failures

##

- Puzzle: why doesn't new+better tech replace old+bad tech?

- So far: supply-side explanations

  - Innovation failures

  - Diffusion failures

- Assumption: people want new+better tech

- Is this true? [Demand-side] failures

## 

<!-- 
1. Preferences
2. 
3. Coordination problems -->

- [Demand-side] failures: problems with demand for 'good' tech

- Happens at three levels:

  - Individual
  
  - Household

  - Social/community
