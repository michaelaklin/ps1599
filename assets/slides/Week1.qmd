# Welfare and technology

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Plan for today

<!-- Theme: 
Goals of society: deontology vs consequentialism
Two forms of consequentialism
Conclusion: we often want to generate the best consequences
What consequences? Happiness (=utility)!
But: doesn't work that great. Nepal. Trump paradox.
Instead: human development.
But: complicated.
Instead: GDP!
Thus: centrality of development for our societies.
