<!-- # Welfare

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

## Plan for today -->

<!-- Theme: 
Goals of society: deontology vs consequentialism
Two forms of consequentialism
Conclusion: we often want to generate the best consequences
What consequences? Happiness (=utility)!
But: doesn't work that great. Nepal. Trump paradox.
Instead: human development. Amartya Sen: development as freedom
But: complicated.
Instead: GDP!
Thus: centrality of development for our societies.

## 

This semester will proceed in three steps:

1. Explain the connections between [technology]{.red}, [development]{.red}, [sustainability]{.red}, and why we (could) want all of these

2. Obstacles to sustainable tech

3. "Big picture": the big challenges ahead

- Plan today: 

  - history of development
 -->

So...

My friend Bob is getting [married]{.blue}. 

My friend Anthony [disapproves]{.red} of Bob's partner. 

Yet my friend Anthony is also Bob's best man...

[Should Anthony let Bob know that he disapproves? Or should he stay silent?]{.blue}

Anthony says that it's the right thing to do, regardless of the consequences...


## Thesis of this course

1. What we want: improve people's [welfare]{.red}

2. What determines welfare? [Economic growth/development]{.red}

3. How do we get development? [Technological innovations]{.red}

- But how [legitimate]{.blue} is this thesis?

- Lots of pushback against the idea that development=good

  - Environmentalists, religions, nationalists, traditionalists

- Today: ethics and development

# Ethics and politics

## Principles of ethics

- To justify a goal: need to think about [ethics]{.red} of our societies

- Three main families of views on an [ideal]{.blue} society looks like [(Bueno de Mesquita et al 2016)]{.gray}

  1. Consequentialist ethics

  2. Deontological ethics

  3. (Virtue ethics)

## 1. Consequentialism

- Idea: what matters is the [consequences]{.red} of our actions

- Colloquially: ends justify the means

- Question: what constitutes a 'good' outcome/consequence?

-  Main views:

  1. Utilitarianism

  2. Egalitarianism

## 1.1. Utilitarianism

<q>Utilitarianism is the view that what matters morally is utility, or happiness, and that the right action in any situation is that which maximizes the total amount of it there is. [(Swift 2013)]{.gray}</q>

- Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832): "the greatest happiness of the greatest number"

- J.S. Mill: utility instead of happiness

- What determines utility?

- **[Thus: if utility=consumption, then development is just]{.red}**

- **Corollary**: tech is justified when it helps development

## 

[Can you think of reasons to disagree with utilitarianism?]{.red}

## Key concerns

- Do the ends justify the means?

- How to deal with perverse preferences?

- How can we measure utility?

## 1.2. Egalitarianism

- Egalitarians agree that consequences is what matters

- Egalitarians disagree that it's about average or total welfare. What matters is its [distribution]{.red}

- Extreme version: equality of outcomes

- **[Thus: development is good when it reduces inequality]{.red}**

- Variants

  - Equality of opportunities and resources (Dworkin)

  - Rawls and Sen

## Rawls

- John Rawls (1921-2002)

- Equality is [rational]{.red}

- Reason: that's what society would pick [behind a veil of ignorance]{.blue}

- (Note: criticized by John Harsanyi and others)

- Inequality is tolerable [only]{.blue} if it helps the most disadvantaged ([difference principle]{.red})

- **[Thus: development is just when it helps the poor]{.red}**

## Sen

- Amartya Sen (1933-)

- [Freedom]{.red} is a moral imperative

- Being free$\neq$no prison

- Being free$\neq$no gov (libertarianism)

- Freedom: having capabilities to meet your aspirations

- **[Thus: development is just when it contributes to freedom]{.red}**

## 2. Other ethical schools

- Kantian deontology

- What matters are [actions]{.red}, not [consequences]{.red}

- Just actions are those that are universal and rational ([categorical imperative]{.red})

- Major challenge against consequentialism

##

My friend Bob is getting [married]{.blue}. 

My friend Anthony [disapproves]{.red} of Bob's partner. 

Yet my friend Anthony is also Bob's best man...

[Should Anthony let Bob know that he disapproves? Or should he stay silent?]{.blue}

Anthony says that it's the right thing to do, regardless of the consequences...

What would your [ideal]{.red} society be like?

## Summary so far

- Consequentialist ethics cares about [outcomes]{.red}

- Outcomes that matter for U and E: [welfare]{.red}

  - Utilitarianism: [average/total]{.blue} welfare

  - Egalitarianism: [distribution]{.blue} of welfare. 
  
  - Rawls, Sen: poorest

- Others tend to care less about welfare. Justifiable!

##

- [My thesis this semester: we should prioritize welfare]{.red}

- (Global) political problems are defined by lower welfare than feasible

- Major caveats!

  - We should think about levels _and_ distribution of welfare

  - Sometimes: doing the right thing $\neq$ improving welfare

  - Welfare is not just about material pleasures

- Next step: how should we [define]{.blue} and [measure]{.blue} welfare?
<!-- 
# Welfare and its definition(s)

##

- Welfare = good. Okay, but what is welfare?

- In practice: vastly diverging views. [Example?]{.red}

- Some communities: spiritual values

- Others (majority?): economic output and growth

## Definitions

- Development (narrow): how advanced an economy is (service sector, innovations, etc.)

- Development (Sen): 

  - Economic opportunities

  - Political freedom

  - Protection from extreme poverty

- Extended version: social development (gender rights, minorities, etc.), modernization

## Sidenote

- Concept of [development]{.blue} is relatively recent: Truman 1949

- Context: Cold War, United Nations, World Bank

- Criticized concept [(Esteva, etc.)]{.gray}:

  - Who decides what counts as 'developed'?

  - Do all countries need to follow the West's path?

- Extensions: imposing western values (eg on gender, capitalism)

- In this class: narrow perspective on economic wellbeing

## Measurement

- Development: sometimes proxied by [GDP]{.blue}

  - Total value created in a jurisdiction over a time period

  - Not the same as household income/wage, but close

  - Doesn't tell us about distribution of income

- Development: sometimes proxied by [Human Development Index]{.blue} (HDI)

  - Schooling + GNI (similar to GDP) + Life expectancy

- GDP vs. HDI

##

- So: welfare = economic growth/development?

- Ultimately: matter of [personal values]{.blue}

  - Eg religion, politics, etc.

- In practice: large shares of populations appear to value economic development (revealed preferences)

- Why? Economic development correlates with many desirable things -->

## Happiness

- Happiness: end goal?

  - Locke: yes!

  - Bentham: yes!

  - US declaration of indepence: yes!

- Does happiness increase with economic development? 

  - Yes [within and across countries]{.blue}

  - Not [over time]{.blue}

  - = Paradox of happiness [(Easterlin 1974)]{.gray}

  - One explanation: hedonic treadmill

## Summary so far

1. What we want: improve people's [welfare]{.red}

  - Reason: welfare is plausibly a **just** goal!

2. What determines welfare? [Economic growth/development]{.red}

  - Welfare could be equated to well-being

  - Development correlates highly with well-being

  - Thus: development is probably good!

3. How do we get development? [Technological innovations]{.red} -->
