::: {.r-fit-text}
What did we talk about last time?
:::

##

- [Demand]{.red} matters for sustainable development

- [Individual]{.red} factors: income, age, gender, education

- [Household]{.red} dynamics: gender, age inequality

  - Example: clean cookstoves, electricity access

- Next: demand at the [societal]{.red} level

  - Social preferences: community, society, state

  - Social failures (next class)



<!-- 

Amish
Luddite
Techo-optimists

 -->

##

- Many decisions are made by [individuals/households]{.blue}...

- Sometimes, [society]{.blue} "makes" decisions

  - Collective decision

  - Example: demand for GMO, local wind turbines, AI

- Three levels

  - [Socio-political]{.red} acceptance

  - [Community]{.red} acceptance

  - [Market]{.red} acceptance

##

- Two very different view of sustainability of development

- Mary Shelley (1797-1851)

  - [Dr.]{.blue} Frankenstein [creates]{.blue} a beast

  - Nature > human rationality

- Bram Stoker (1847-1912)

  - [Dr.]{.blue} Van Helsing [solves]{.blue} the beast

  <!-- - Dracula: repulsive but (kind of) natural -->

  - Human rationality > nature

- Conflicting views by society on tech development

# Social acceptance

##

- Culture

  - Attitudes toward technology

  - Depends on priorities, values, and impact

- Economic factors

  - Threat to specific workers

  - Threat to [regions]{.red} ([poverty traps]{.red})

## Example: Amish

- Amish: Christian protestant subgroup, DE-FR-CH

- First wave in US/PA early 1700s (rel tolerance)

- Focus on [community]{.red} (vs individual pride) 

  - Tech rejection: threat to social ties+values ("_Ordnung_")

  - Tech rejection: defines against outsiders ("English")

  - Hard to change ([veto power]{.red} of 2+indiv and neighbor [peer pressure]{.red})

- Elec (1910): threat to indep, fight w/ Mennonites

## Example: Luddites and machines

- Nottingham, 1811: mob led by "Ned Lud" destroys new textile tech (+1 death)

- Origin of the term "[luddite]{.red}"

- Mistakenly interpreted as anti-tech

- Instead: worry of high- (vs low-)skilled workers

- Impact of tech depends on complementarity with workers

  - 20th century: tech helps high-skilled workers

  - Before+after: tech often hurts high-skilled workers

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
Consider the threat from [automation]{.red}.
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
Can you design policies to both [promote]{.blue} new tech...
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
and [protect]{.blue} at-risk people?
:::

##

- 1st approach: reduce inequality _ex ante_

  - Even the playground

  - Eg tax on robots, subsidies for workers

  - Downside: slows tech

- 2nd approach: compensate _ex post_

  - Let tech be deployed, help those hurt

  - Eg: unemployment insurance, re-skilling programs, etc.

  - Downside: not always [credible]{.red}



# Community acceptance

##

- Society is often too broad

- Community: local society

- Decisions over tech: often at community level

- Culture + economics still matter...

- Here: importance of [equality]{.red}/[justice]{.red}

- Tech often has [distributional consequences]{.red}: winners/losers

[Who]{.blue} will host [unsustainable]{.red} tech?
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
[Who]{.blue} will host [sustainable]{.red} tech?
:::

##

- Who hosts bad tech is never neutral

- Some distributional consequences depend on [econ]{.red} factors...

- But many depend on [politics]{.red}

- Top-down biases: who controls the agenda?

- Bottom-up biases: who mobilizes?


## Example: NIMBY-ism

- Consider transportation: roads=critical infrastructure

- But where should they be built? 

- NIMBYism: not in my backyward

- Three problems

  - Infrastructure (roads) are needed for econ growth!

  - Decision-makers will not treat everyone equally

  - Communities won't all mobilize equally

<!-- ## Example: pollution inequality

## Example: New York City highways -->

# Country-level demand

##

- So far: individuals, households, community, society

- Some decisions: country- or nation-level

- Two ways to think about this:

  - Culture

  - Politics/international relations 

# Culture

## Impact of culture

- [Culture]{.red} = "shared values, norms, beliefs, and preferences" of a society [@galor2022journey]

- Individuals are embedded in culture

- Affects:

  - Priorities $\rightarrow$ development of new ideas

  - Acceptance $\rightarrow$ adoption of new ideas

- Markets depend on trust, networks ([social capital]{.red}) (eg S vs N Italy)

## Origins of culture

- General rule: culture is [conservative]{.blue}

  - Old norms/values: proven track record

  - Role of religions, arts, etc.

- "[Evolutionary theory]{.blue}" of cultural change

  - Accidental new cultural traits (eg conflict)

  - Survival depends on advantage they provide

- In post-Ind Rev: cultural traits that help w/ new tech

  - Enlightenment (Kant, etc.)

  - Eg: literacy in Protestant (and Jewish) culture (Weber)

# Politics & international relations

## Adoption

- Technology is broadly a [public good]{.red}

- Spreads [within]{.blue} and [across]{.blue} countries

- [2nd image reversed]{.red}

  - "2nd image": countries affect global politics

  - "2nd image reversed": global pol affect countries

  - [(Policy) diffusion]{.red} processes

::: footer
@Gourevitch1978
:::

## Mechanisms of diffusion

- Why do tech spread globally? Many mechanisms

- [Learning]{.red}

  - 1st-mover country in R&D: public good

  - 2nd-mover advantage

- [Competition]{.red}

  - International markets

  - Evolutionary process

- [Coercion]{.red}: forced acquisition of goods/tech

::: footer
@berger2013commercial, @Dobbinetal2007
:::

## Rejection

- Why would tech ever be rejected?

- Adoption of (sustainable) tech has [distributional]{.red} consequences

- "Selectorate": govs cater to whoever keeps them in power

  - Democracies: broad set of supporters needed

  - Autocracies: narrow set (eg army)

- General rule: need to look at [who]{.blue} is affected

::: footer
@BDMetal2003

##

::: {.r-fit-text}
What do you think the [political rationale]{.blue}
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
to promote/block internet is?
:::

## Example: internet

- New technology

- Considerable economic benefits

  - Access, diffusion of information

  - Access to customers

  - = good for economic growth

- But considerable hostility from autocracies

  - Lower cost of social mobilization

##

![Source: @Milner2006](./materials/milner2006_fig1.png)

##

- How can you combine growth and control?

- Solution: more tech (firewalls, internet police, software filters, etc) + barriers (cost)

- China: censorship of...

  - certain websites

  - publications

  - private speech, when about collection action

# Conclusion

##

- Tech adoption is not just an individual decision

- Society+community+state matter

  - Culture

  - Economy

  - Politics

- Not a good vs. bad

  - Different priorities (eg Amish)

  - NIMBYism: sometimes good, sometimes bad

- But for sustainable tech to work: need community+political support
