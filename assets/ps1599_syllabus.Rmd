# Teaching assistant

The teaching assistant for this course is Chuang Chen (chen.chuang@pitt.edu). He will be in charge of helping students complete their _research report_ (see "Assignments"). 

Note that all questions regarding the substance of this course or its organization should be addressed to me instead (aklin@pitt.edu).

\bigskip

# Course Objectives

This course has two objectives. First, it has a _substantive_ objective. It is to help students understand the politics behind sustainable development and technology. Technology has been the driver of unprecedented improvements in welfare over the last 2-3 centuries. Yet technological innovation is also connected to many challenges that our societies face, such as climate change. Not addressing them properly creates major risks for our future welfare.

Second, this course has also an _analytical_ objective. Students will be asked to do applied research with an eye on developing their problem-solving skills to address real issues. 

\bigskip

# Requirements

**Assignments**. 

* Midterm: 30%. See schedule.

* Research report: 40%. Due on 21/4.

* Policy report: 30%. Due on 21/4.

More details about these assignments will be provided in class. The Research report and the Policy report must be submitted on Canvas.

<!--  
Midterm
Research report = short research memo.
Policy report = literature + summary of research report + policy suggestions
-->

**Grade scale**: 0 < 60: F, 60 < 64: D-, 64 < 67: D, 67 < 70: D+, 70 < 73: C-, 74 < 77: C, 77 < 80: C+, 80 < 84: B-, 84 < 87: B, 87 < 90: B+, 90 < 94: A-, 93 or more: A. "Y < X" means: "from Y up to, but not including X." Grades are not rounded up.

**Late submissions** are penalized by a loss of 2 percentage points per day. If you have issues that prevent you from submitting an assignment on time, then please let me know immediately. If you inform me _after_ a deadline has passed, I will need to be provided justification (e.g. doctor's note) to cancel the late submission penalty. 

**Important note**: you can discuss ideas with your fellow students, but you must do your assignments individually. For pedagogical reasons, it is essential that you must try to understand the material on your own.

## `r advdate(mon, 1)`. Introduction + Welfare

What should the goal of our societies be?

<!-- Theme: 
Goals of society: deontology vs consequentialism
Two forms of consequentialism
Conclusion: we often want to generate the best consequences
What consequences? Happiness (=utility)!
But: doesn't work that great. Nepal. Trump paradox.
Instead: human development.
But: complicated.
Instead: GDP!
Thus: centrality of development for our societies.
-->

_Required reading_:

## `r advdate(mon, 2)`. Welfare and technology

<!-- Theme
Welfare is great!
Where does development come from? Technology!
- Brynjolfson
Technology:
- is something that has been both liked and disklided: Dracula vs. Frankenstein
- In an idea world
-->

In the long-term, welfare depends almost entirely on innovations and their deployment. 

Note: no class on Monday (MLK Day).

_Suggested reading_:

* `r ref("BrynjolfssonMcAfee2016")`

<!--------------- Break --------------->
## `r advdate(mon, 3)`. Technology and sustainability

Technology has also a darker side and creates considerable negative side effects.

<!-- Themes: 
Last time: development is key and it is caused by technology.

But: negative externalities of technology
- Society (social media)
- Economy (automation, coal phaseout)
- Environment (climate, air pollution)
-> Consequences: rise of extremism!

Creates the problem of sustainability
- What do we mean by sustainability and sustainable development?
Need for new sustainable technology
Problem: all kinds of reasons this doesn't work

New technology needs to be developed. But who wants to pay for research?

<!-- Themes: 

Models/theory:

# Course policies

## Pandemic/COVID

During this pandemic, it is extremely important that you abide by the public health regulations, the University of Pittsburghâs health standards and guidelines, and Pitt's Health Rules. These rules have been developed to protect the health and safety of all of us.  Universal face covering is required in all classrooms and in every building on campus, without exceptions, regardless of vaccination status. This means you must wear a face covering that properly covers your nose and mouth when you are in the classroom. If you do not comply, you will be asked to leave class.  It is your responsibility have the required face covering when entering a university building or classroom. For the most up-to-date information and guidance, please visit https://coronavirus.pitt.edu and check your Pitt email for updates before each class.

If you are required to isolate or quarantine, become sick, or are unable to come to class, contact me as soon as possible to discuss arrangements.

## Disability Resource Services

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and the Office of Disability Resources and Services, 140 William Pitt Union, 412-648-7890, as early as possible in the term. Disability Resources and Services will verify your disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.

## Academic Integrity Policy 

Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, noted below, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz, exam or paper will be imposed. (For the full Academic Integrity policy, go to www.provost.pitt.edu/info/ai1.html.)

## E-mail Communication Policy

Each student is issued a University e-mail address (username@pitt.edu) upon admittance. This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication with students. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications. The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e-mail via other service providers (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address. To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full E-mail Communication Policy, go to www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html.)

## Diversity and Inclusion

The University of Pittsburgh does not tolerate any form of discrimination,harassment, or retaliation based on disability, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, geneticinformation, marital status, familial status, sex, age, sexual orientation, veteran status or gender iden-tity or other factors as stated in the Universityâs Title IX policy. The University is committed to takingprompt action to end a hostile environment that interferes with the Universityâs mission. For moreinformation about policies, procedures, and practices, see: https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/about. I ask that everyone in the class strive to help ensure that other members of this class can learn in a support-ive and respectful environment. If there are instances of the aforementioned issues, please contact theTitle IX Coordinator, by calling 412-648-7860, or e-mailing titleixcoordinator@pitt.edu. Reports canalso be filed online: https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/civil-rights-title-ix-compliance/make-report.
